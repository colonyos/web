    <h1>What is Colonies?</h1>
    <b><a href="https://github.com/colonyos/colonies">Colonies</a></b> is an open-source project initiated by <a
        href="https://www.ri.se">RISE AB</a>,
    designed to streamline computational workloads across various platforms. Colonies provides a <b>distributed runtime
        environment</b>, known as a <i><b>Colony</b></i>, enabling development, deployment, and execution of
    microservices ubiquitously over the
    Internet. This allows for seamless integration with other systems and creation of <i><b>Compute Continuums</b></i>.
    <br>
    <br>
    A Colony is a loosely-coupled collection of distributed microservices called <b>Executors</b>. A zero-trust
    security protocol based on the principle <i><b>trust, but verify</b></i> enables the Executors to operate as a
    unified
    entity. Each colony is governed by a private key that serves as a central authority, analogous to <i><b>one ring to
            rule them all</b></i>, making it possible to control a Colony as if it was a single machine.
    <br>

    <br>
    <br>
    A fundamental concept is the notion of <b>processes</b> which contains meta-information about
    computations to be carried out by the Executors. Colonies provides a protocol that enables Executors to publish
    instructions that are subsequently assigned to other Executor members of the same Colony. In this way, the Colonies
    serves as a job broker, almost like an employment agency for people. By linking the
    instructions into
    Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) it becomes possible to seamlessly execute workloads across platforms.

    <h1>Use cases</h1>
    <ul>
        <li> <b>Edge computing</b>. Implement and run an Executor on a drone to offload computation to an edge server.
        </li>
        <li> <b>High-performance computing</b>. Develop hybrid workflows running both on HPC (e.g. Slurm) and
            Kubernetes.
        </li>
        <li> <b>Serverless computing</b>. Develop a FaaS platform to run functions across platforms.</li>
        <li> <b>Distributed processing</b>. Build scalable and robust data pipelines on Kubernetes to process e.g. Earth
            Observation data.</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Key features</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Colonies builds on <a href="https://etcd.io/">Etcd</a> and is <b>scalable</b> and <b>robust</b>. Processes
            not finishing in time are automatically re-assigned to other Executors.
        </li>
        <li>A <b>built-in crypto-protocol</b>
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_Curve_Digital_Signature_Algorithm">ECDSA</a>
            (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm)
            provides identity management and secure process execution.
        </li>
        <li><b>A HTTP-based protocol</b> ensure that Executors can reside anywhere on the Internet,
            even behind firewalls. The Colonies server never establish connections directly to an Executor.</li>
        <li><b>Multi-step workflows</b></li>
        <li><b>Workflow templates</b> to automatically spawn new workflows based on external events or timeouts.</li>
        <li><b>Cron</b> to schedule workflows to be executed in the future. </li>
        <li><b>Traceability</b>. Full process execution history is stored and can be used for auditing and debugging.
        </li>
