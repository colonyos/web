    <h1>What is ColonyOS and Colonies?</h1>
    ColonyOS is an open-source project created by <a href="https://www.ri.se/sv">RISE AB</a> to orchestrate AI/ML
    workloads across heterogeneous computing platforms. The main component of ColonyOS is a service called
    <b><a href="https://github.com/colonyos/colonies"> Colonies</a>.</b>
    <br>
    <br>
    Colonies provides functionality to establish trusted
    distributed computing environments, process management, and functionality to orchestrate workloads.
    It is a building block to implement a
    <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta-system">Meta-Operating System</a></b>, an overlay built on
    top of existing operating systems and platforms to create <i>compute continuums spanning devices,
        webapps, clouds, edges, and HPC platforms</i>.
    <br>
    <br>
    The core idea of Colonies is to split up complex workloads in two layers, a <b>Meta-layer</b> and an
    <b>Execution-layer</b>.

    <br>
    <br>
    <img width="800px" src="/meta-os.png">
    <br>
    <ul>
        <li>The <b>Meta-layer</b> makes it possible to describe and manage complex workflows
            as <b>meta-processes</b> independently of implementation and execution environment.</li>

        <li>The <b>Execution-layer</b> provides a serverless computing environment where developers can implement
            workers capable of executing certain types of meta-processes. AI applications can then be broken
            down into composable functions executed by remote workers anywhere on the Internet.</li>

        <li>A build-in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_trust_security_model">zero-trust protocol</a> makes
            it possible to organize remote workers as a
            single unit called a <b>Colony</b>, thus making it possible for users to keep control even if
            workloads are spread out and executed on many different platforms at the same time.</li>
    </ul>
    See <a href="https://github.com/colonyos/colonies">GitHub</a> for more information.
    <br>
    <br>
    Colonies is used today by <a href="https://www.rocksigma.com">RockSigma AB</a> to implement a High-Performance
    seismic processing engine for underground mines on top of Kubernetes.


    <h1>How does it work?</h1>
    <ul>
        <li> Humans (or workers) submit meta-processes to a Colony via a Colonies server. </li>
        <li> Colonies workers connect to the Colonies server and search for suitable meta-processes to execute. </li>
        <li> Each worker must have a valid identity (like a passport) to prove its Colony membership and the
            Colonies server makes sure only authorized and qualified workers can connect and be assigned processes.</li>
        <li> Colonies workers can reside anywhere on the Internet, e.g. a server, inside a Kubernetes Pod,
            a smart phone app, or embedded in a web page</li>
        <li>If a worker fails to execute a process in time, the process will be re-assigned to another worker.
            This fail-safe mechanism ensures that all processes are eventually completed.
            This also makes it possible to apply <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_engineering">Chaos
                Engineering</a>, e.g. randomly kill workers to test the overall
            stability of the system.</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Key features</h1>
    <ul>
        <li><b>High-availability</b>. Colonies is based on <a href="https://etcd.io/">Etcd</a> and is scalable and
            robust.</li>
        <li>A built-in crypto-protocol
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_Curve_Digital_Signature_Algorithm">ECDSA</a>
            (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm)
            provides identity management and secure and zero-trust process execution.
        </li>
        <li><b>Robust batch processing and distributed RPC</b>. Processes not finishing in time are
            automatically moved back to the job queue to be executed by another worker. </li>
        <li><b>Pull-based orchestration</b>. Users (or workers) submit meta process specifications the Colonies server.
            Colonies workers connect to the Colonies server and request processes to execute.
            A HTTP Long Polling/WebSocket protocol ensure that workers can reside anywhere on the Internet,
            even behind firewalls. The Colonies server never establish connections directly to workers.</li>
        <li><b>Multi-step workflows</b> or Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) to capture dependencies between jobs.</li>
        <li><b>Generators</b> to automatically spawn new workflows based on external events or timeouts.</li>
        <li><b>Cron</b> to schedule process to be executed sometime in the future. </li>
        <li><b>Traceability</b>, full process execution history can be stored and used for auditing.</li>
        <li>Implemented in <b>Golang</b>.</li>
        <li><b>SDKs</b> in <a href="https://github.com/colonyos/rustrt">Rust</a>,
            <a href="https://github.com/colonyos/pyruntime">Python</a>,
            <a href="https://github.com/colonyos/ColonyRuntime.jl">Julia</a>,
            <a href="https://github.com/colonyos/haskellrt">Haskell</a>,
            <a href="https://github.com/colonyos/colonyruntime.js">JavaScript</a>, and
            <a href="https://github.com/colonyos/colonies/tree/main/pkg/client">Golang</a>.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Kubernetes</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>In addition to orchestrate workflows acress platforms, Colonies also makes it possible to orchestrate
            processes
            inside containers. This is far more efficient than launching a new container for each new job like Argo
            Workflows. This is especially important when dealing with AI workflows consisting of huge containers (tens
            of
            gigabytes) or when a large amount of data needs to be shuffled into memory.</li>
        <li>Colonies complements Kubernetes and brings robust and fault tolerant batch processing to Kubernetes,
            typically
            needed by many AI workloads.
        </li>
        <li>At the same time, Colonies is lightweight and does not require Kubernetes. It runs in browsers, smart phones
            or
            IoT devices. This also makes it much easier to develop and test complex workflows before they are deployed
            on
            Kubernetes.</li>
        <li>Most existing frameworks are not built on top of a crypto-protocol, which makes them hard to use in an
            overlay
            across platforms and untrusted networks.</li>
